spring.application.name=ecommerce
# Change the default port to 8081 (or any other port you prefer)
server.port=8080

# You can configure other properties as needed. Here are a few examples:

# Set the logging level for the application (optional)
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG

# Set a context path if you want to change the base URL path (optional)
# server.servlet.context-path=/myapp

# You can also configure other settings like database connections, etc. For now, we have just the port setting.
