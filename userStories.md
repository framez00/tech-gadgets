## Searching an item
As a tech buyer, I want to search for an item so that I can add it to my cart.
Given that the application displays list of items, when the buyer clicks search bar and enters keyword and clicks “enter” button, it will display the list of items available. Then the buyer selects item they want to buy and clicks “add to cart”.

## Incrementing shopping cart
Once you select an item and click “add to cart”, the cart should display a number that tells the customer how many items they added to the cart.

## Checking items in cart
First you need to have selected one or more items to add to the cart. Then you will click on the cart button, and it will redirect you to another page. You will be able to see the items you selected, see your subtotal, and have the option to remove items. You can then continue to buy the items by clicking “continue” or ”payment”.
