Names: Fahim Ramez, Vardges Gasparyan, Mercedes Tamayo, Gabriel Jose Lopez

Project: E-Commerce website for tech and gadgets

## Installation:
1. Open a folder where you want to clone the repository
- you can create a file such as comp380, and then another one called tech&gadgets

2. Clone the repository
- click on the green **<> Code** button, select **SSH**, and copy the link
- use the command **git clone** and paste the link
- should look like git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git

3. Contributing
- when working on a task create a new branch and work independently on your task
- create branch: **git checkout -b branchname**, use a branchname that describes what you are doing so it is organised and easy to follow
- then you start working on your code
- once you want to save your progress, you need to add the files with the command **git add** followed by the file name. You can also add all edited files by using **git add .**
- commit your changes with **git commit -m "message"**, you need to add a descriptive message based on what you did. For example if you fixed a bug, be specific and say what bug you fixed, it helps with the organisation of the project and if we need to go back we will find the relevant part much faster.
- pull the latest changes from the main branch with **git pull origin main**
- push your changes with **git push origin branchname**
